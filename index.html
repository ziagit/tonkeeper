            <h2>Introducing Tonkeeper Battery</h2>
            <p>We are excited to announce a major new feature: Tonkeeper Battery. It is in public beta and available on all mobile platforms starting today.</p>
            <p>Tonkeeper Battery removes an obstacle for newcomers: you can get a stablecoin or an NFT and use them right away without acquiring native coins to pay for gas. You wonâ€™t need to go to an exchange, pass KYC checks, enter a lot of details only to buy a random amount of coins you did not think you needed.</p>
            <p>With Tonkeeper Battery you will never have to worry about gas anymore. Top up your battery with a banking card or a stablecoin, and use all features of your wallet right away.</p>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>With Tonkeeper Battery you can receive tokens (stablecoins, NFTs etc.) and make payments with a token â€” without going to an exchange to buy coins to cover blockchain fees. Tonkeeper Battery pays your fees for you, automatically.</p>
            <p>You can charge the battery with one tap using in-app purchases, or with TON or stablecoins. Send a few dollars worth of stablecoins or TON to a special address: <strong>battery.ton</strong> and it will automatically apply charges to your account.</p>
            <p>Tonkeeper Battery is denominated in charges, each charge covers the fee of a simple TON transfer transaction. More complex transactions may consume 5, 10 or more charges.</p>

            <h2>Start using battery today</h2>
            <p>Update Tonkeeper on iOS and Android to version 4.3, then top up the battery in Settings â†’ Battery. Once charged, the battery status will appear on the main screen.</p>
            <p>We are still testing the battery: some kinds of transactions are not supported yet. When charging via battery.ton we only support jUSDT and TON, other tokens will be added later.</p>
